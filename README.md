# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees

In this guided project, I'll work on visualizing the gender gap across college degrees. I will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. In the last step, I'll explore how to export the final diagram created, as an image file.

The CSV file can be found in the same repository.
